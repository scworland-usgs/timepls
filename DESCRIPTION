Title: Partial least squares (pls) regression on time series data.
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Scott Worland
Maintainer: The package maintainer <scworland@usgs.gov>
Description: Contains functions for calculating partial least squares regression for time series. 
    This method is useful when it is not clear what lags will generate the strongest correlation 
    between several time series. Furthermore, this package also allows a user to input different 
    window widths for calculating fit metrics. The output plots are similar to wavelet 
    time-frequency plots, but here we present time-window width plots.
